transiki is a wiki of transit data, see transiki.org

FIXME link to codebase, wiki, mailing list, etc...

To isntall this, I needed to :
0. install the prereqs from the debian/control file
1. run the scrip in debian/gems.sh
2. setup the database like debian/database.sh
3. install the /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf like debian/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf
the just run dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc to try and build.

you will get some errors. my results are currently in debian/testlog.txt.

more to come

Mike
